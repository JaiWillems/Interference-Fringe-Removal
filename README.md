# Interference-Fringe-Removal (IFR)

The IFR project is a data handling program for the FAR-IR beamline of the Canadian Light Source Inc.. The platform uses an in house method to remove interference fringes from OPUS spectrometry data.

## Preliminary Model
The initial model will invoke apodization functions, Mertz corrections, data truncation, and a sries of Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms to remove the interference fringes in a Terminal style UI application.

## Future Additions
Long term goals of the project will be to create a guided user interface for fringe selection and additive/subtractive manipulation of interferograms and spectrographs. Additionally, innovative methods of fringe removal will be explored and incorporated.
